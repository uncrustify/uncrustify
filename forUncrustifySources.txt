The configuration file forUncrustifySources.cfg is the file to uncrustify the sources of uncrustify.

It should be "stable". This means that if one changes (allmost) anything in a file, a new run of
uncrustify with that configuration file, should produce the same output as the original input. 
This cannot work for really anything, but one should try this approach.

About the comments:
While a line is indented, the comment at the end of the line stays at the original column.

If we have:
      else if ((pc->type == CT_FUNC_CLASS_DEF) ||
               (pc->type == CT_FUNC_DEF) ||
               (pc->type == CT_FUNC_CLASS_PROTO) ||
               (pc->type == CT_FUNC_PROTO))
      {                  // guy 2016-04-16

where the brace { is at new line with a comment.
The option nl_elseif_brace = remove
gives:
      else if ((pc->type == CT_FUNC_CLASS_DEF) ||
                 (pc->type == CT_FUNC_DEF) ||
                 (pc->type == CT_FUNC_CLASS_PROTO) ||
                 (pc->type == CT_FUNC_PROTO)) { // guy 2016-04-16
If using at new the same option again with a new value
nl_elseif_brace = add
is not able to reconstruct the original source. The comment has changed the line:
      else if ((pc->type == CT_FUNC_CLASS_DEF) ||
               (pc->type == CT_FUNC_DEF) ||
               (pc->type == CT_FUNC_CLASS_PROTO) ||
               (pc->type == CT_FUNC_PROTO))       // guy 2016-04-16
      {
