README for Uncrustify4Qt
========================

October 2015:
This is a copy from uncrustify, version 0.61
We make little changes and extent the software to support the Qt-Software
  http://www.qt.io/

Post any bugs to the issue tracker found on the project's Sourceforge page:
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/uncrustify

Please include the following with your issue:
  - a description of what is not working right
  - input code sufficient to demonstrate the issue
  - expected output code
  - configuration options used to generate the output

If the issue cannot be easily reproduced, then it isn't likely to be fixed.


Building the program
--------------------

Quick start:
  $ mkdir build
  $ cd build
  $ cmake ../src
  $ make

The executable is build/uncrustify4Qt.
Copy that to your ~/bin/ folder or wherever you want.


Configuring the program
-----------------------

Examine the example config files in etc and/or read
documentation/htdocs/configuration.txt.
Copy the existing config file that closely matches your style and put in
~/.uncrustify/.  Modify to your liking.


Running the program (and refining your style)
---------------------------------------------

As of the current release, I don't particularly trust this program to not make
mistakes and screw up my whitespace formatting.

Here's how to run it:
  $ uncrustify4Qt -c ~/.uncrustify/mystyle.cfg -f somefile.c > somefile.c.unc

The -c option selects the configuration file.
The -f option specifies the input file.
The output is sent to stdout.  Error messages are sent to stderr.

Use a quality side-by-side diff tool to determine if the program did what you
wanted.
Repeat until your style is refined.
