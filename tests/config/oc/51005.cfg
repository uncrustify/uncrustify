# Config to trigger the case colon after ternary bug
# This requires pos_conditional = lead which moves conditional colons to the
# beginning of the next line. When case colons are misclassified as conditional
# colons (COND_COLON instead of CASE_COLON), they get moved to a new line too.
pos_conditional = lead
