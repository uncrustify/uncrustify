# Config to trigger the OC message colon misclassification bug in multi-line messages.
# This requires sp_cond_colon = force which adds spaces around conditional colons.
# When OC message colons are misclassified as conditional colons (COND_COLON
# instead of OC_COLON), they get spurious spaces added.
#
# The bug occurs when:
# 1. A multi-line OC message send contains a ternary expression in an argument
# 2. The ternary colon is correctly identified as CT_COND_COLON
# 3. But subsequent OC message colons on FOLLOWING LINES are incorrectly
#    classified as CT_COND_COLON instead of CT_OC_COLON
sp_cond_colon = force
