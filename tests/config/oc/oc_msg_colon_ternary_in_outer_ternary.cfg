# Config to trigger OC message colon misclassification when
# an OC message with ternaries using the "value:nil" pattern
# is nested inside an outer ternary expression.
#
# The bug occurs when:
# 1. An outer ternary expression has an OC message as its true branch
# 2. The OC message contains parameters with ternary values like "paramA:cond ? val:nil"
# 3. The subsequent OC selector colons (profileID:, tapAction:) get incorrectly
#    marked as CT_COND_COLON and receive spurious spaces
