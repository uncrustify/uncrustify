# Config to trigger the OC message colon misclassification bug with nested ternaries.
# This requires sp_cond_colon = force which adds spaces around conditional colons.
# When OC message colons are misclassified as conditional colons (COND_COLON
# instead of OC_COLON), they get spurious spaces added.
#
# The bug occurs when:
# 1. A ternary expression's branches contain ObjC message calls
# 2. Those inner ObjC message calls contain ternary expressions in their arguments
# 3. The subsequent OC message colon (on the next line) is incorrectly
#    classified as CT_COND_COLON instead of CT_OC_COLON
sp_cond_colon = force
