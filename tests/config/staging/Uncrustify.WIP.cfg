# Setting this 'false' will cause an extra tab to be added to function call args from an assignment:
#
# x = o.Func2(a, b,
#         y);
# o.Func2(a, b,
#     y);
#
# ...but setting it 'true' is often worse:
#
# ExtraReallyLongType reallyLongVariableName = someTest
#                                            ? someTrueExpr
#                                            : someFalseExpr
#
# ...except sometimes we really do want that. What we need is an indent_align_assign_threshold, or,
# better but maybe more complicated, indent_align_assign=ignore to leave alone what the engineer did.
# (currently unreported)
indent_align_assign=false

# this is causing a few problems, but usually with block comments and autodoc markup. perhaps only add a space
# if first letter is not a symbol and this is a standalone comment: not preceded or followed by another c++
# comment line at the same level of indentation.
# REVISIT: work was done to have it eliminate space for doxygen markup in c6aca7b, maybe can improve on it for us
# (test using Runtime/Allocator/BucketAllocator.h)
# IMPORTANT: see task at https://trello.com/c/wUgiuvbX before going further
