### This file holds rules common to C++ and C# so we can process .bindings files that have been temporarily modified to permit uncrustify working on them

include Uncrustify.Common-Cpp.cfg

# because .bindings files don't have braces for classes/structs/enums, it can really ruin the vertical spacing if uncrustify
# removes these types of lines. let's just leave them alone.
