/**
 * @file backup.h
 * Handles backing up file data.
 *
 * It works like this:
 *
 * 1. Read in the file data
 *
 * 2. Call backup_copy_file() to create a backup of the input, if needed
 *
 * 3. Do the uncrustify magic and write the output file
 *
 * 4. Call backup_create_md5_file()
 *
 * This will let you run uncrustify multiple times over the same file without
 * losing the original file.  If you edit the file, then a new backup is made.
