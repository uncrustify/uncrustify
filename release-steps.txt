Release steps.
Just in case I don't do a release for a while and forget what to do... =)

0. Update the following two lines and paste into a terminal:

UNC_URL=https://uncrustify.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/uncrustify
UNC_REL=0.51

1. Make sure all tests pass

   Run all tests (requires python):

     cd tests
     ./run_tests.py

2. Make sure it builds on Windows

3. Update the version number.
Replace the old version with the new version everywhere except in ChangeLog.
Specific files to update:
    configure.in
    documentation/htdocs/index.html
    man/uncrustify.1 (man file)
    src/uncrustify_version.h
Run "sh autogen.sh".

3a. Rebuild from scratch (make clean && make)

4. Update the config files
$ scripts/update-defaults.sh

4a. Update the man file, if any command-line options have changed.

5. Update the ChangeLog to indicate the release date

6. Make sure there are no modified files in the workspace.

7. Copy the trunk to a tag
$ svn cp $UNC_URL/trunk/uncrustify $UNC_URL/tags/uncrustify-$UNC_REL -m "uncrustify-$UNC_REL"

8. Export to the release folder
$ cd ../releases
$ svn export $UNC_URL/tags/uncrustify-$UNC_REL

9. Tar up the files
$ tar czf uncrustify-$UNC_REL.tgz uncrustify-$UNC_REL

REVISIT: consider splitting the tests out from the source

10. Update and build on windows
Copy the exe, ChangeLog, index.html, and all the .cfg files in etc into a
folder named "uncrustify-$UNC_REL-win32".
Zip up that folder using the folder name + ".zip"
Copy to the release folder on Linux

11. Copy the files to sourceforge
$ sftp USER@frs.sourceforge.net
sftp> cd uploads
sftp> put uncrustify-0.XX.tgz
sftp> put uncrustify-0.XX-win32.tgz
sftp> exit

12. Update the web page files
$ cd uncrustify-$UNC_REL/documentation/htdocs
$ scp -r * USER,uncrustify@web.sourceforge.net:htdocs/

13. Use the web interface to create the release and attach the files

14. (optional) Create a news item

15. (optional) Update freshmeat.net project
